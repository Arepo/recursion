Another Makers exercise - write a couple of methods using recursion:

One to sum an array (without using inject)
One to check if an array is a palindrome (without using reverse). (I was very pleased with the elegance of this one)

To try them out, navigate to the lib directory containing them, open IRB, and type "require 'arraysum'" and "require 'palindrome'". You can call the methods themselves with sum(arr) and palindrome?(arr)
